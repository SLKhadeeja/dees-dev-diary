      <h2>My baby steps into tech</h2>
      <h5>About me</h5>
      <p>
        I am a software developer and a graduate of computer engineering. When
        I'm not coding, I'm watching Animes, sleeping or reading (Books, mangas,
        webcomics and anything that I find captivating).
      </p>
      <h5>Why tech?</h5>
      <p>
        I have always been fascinated with technology. I loved puzzles and
        anything with a formulae/syntax (yes, I'm talking about the incredible
        mathematics😁). Unfortunately, I had no one to put me through until I
        got into the university and realized C programming language was part of
        the second year syllabus; I was excited. I couldn't wait to start it.
      </p>
      <h5>Hello world and Basics</h5>
      <p>
        My first hello world display felt wonderful. I felt so accomplished. I
        went back home and kept printing outputs. I was so proud of myself and
        of course the fact that my family kept asking questions was wonderful. I
        finally felt like someone in tech. Writing code for mathematical
        equations became my favorite pastime. As a newbie, I didn't know the
        value of " understanding one before going to the next", so when I found
        out C++ was part of year 3, I dove in🤦🏽‍♀️. I spent my holiday learning
        everything about basic C++.
      </p>
      <h5>Getting Comfortable</h5>
      <p>
        The tech community always finds its kind and my case wasn't different.
        When my classmates found out about my interests, I finally got a nudge
        in the right direction. I attended meetups, workshops and got introduced
        to platforms where I could ask questions and improve.I finally decided
        to settle first for python for data science before getting into web
        development.
      </p>
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        I can proudly say that, in the past two years, I have safely made it out
        of noob coder and I'm in that little space between noob and intermediate
        level.😊
